# MRes

Hello! My name is Kim, and I study Statistics and Operational Research at [STOR-i](http://www.stor-i.lancs.ac.uk/), Lancaster University. My main areas of research interest are high-dimensional optimisation and decision-making under uncertainty - how do you "optimise" a decision output from a model too complex for a human to properly understand when you're not even sure if your input data is correct?

This GitHub is a storage place for some of my project work for the MRes I'm currently doing in preparation for progression to a PhD in the field.
