## Hackathons

As part of the programme of teaching at the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, we have "problem-solving days" where an industrial partner visits with a real-world problem they'd like some help with. All of the PhD students attending split into teams and spend a day coming up with quick-fire solutions, and then at the end of the day we present them back to the industrial partner. We get some experience of a wide variety of real-world data science challenges, and they get the insight of a dozen fresh and well-trained eyes on their problem.

This folder contains some of the code I've used to help solve and investigate these challenges.
